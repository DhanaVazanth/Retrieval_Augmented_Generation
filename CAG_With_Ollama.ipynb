    "----------------\n",
    "Concept Retrieval ‚Üí Fetches relevant concepts from structured sources (e.g., Knowledge Graphs like DBpedia, Wikidata).\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Expansion ‚Üí Maps related concepts and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmented Generation ‚Üí Uses the retrieved concepts to generate responses with deeper reasoning.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "CAG: Retrieves the concepts of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, sustainable energy, and Elon Musk‚Äôs involvement, forming a richer response.\n",

    "------------\n",
    "Ideal for domain-specific knowledge (e.g., legal, medical, financial AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps with explainability and fact-based generation.\n",
    "\n",
